## Description
The code above creates a simple screenshot tool using the Python tkinter library. The tool allows users to specify a delay in seconds before taking a screenshot. The screenshot is then saved as a PNG file with a timestamped name.

## Setup Instruction
To run the code, you will need to have the Python tkinter and pyautogui libraries installed. You can install them using the following commands:

Here are the steps on how to run the code:

1. Install the Python tkinter and pyautogui libraries.<br/>
    ``pip install tkinter pyautogui``

2. Save the code as a Python file.<br/>``screenshot.py``
3. Run the code from the command line and write this command:<br/>``python screenshot.py``
4. Specify the delay in seconds before taking a screenshot.
5. Click the "Take Screenshot" button to capture the screenshot.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
