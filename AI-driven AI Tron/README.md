Package/Script Name: AI-driven AI Tron

Short Description: AI-driven AI Tron is a Python script that implements an AI player for the game "AI Tron," also known as Snake or Light Cycles. The AI player uses the Alpha-Beta Pruning algorithm to make intelligent moves and maximize its chances of winning.

Functionalities/Script:

TronGame class: Represents the AI Tron game and handles game logic.
AI_move(): Implements the AI's move using the Alpha-Beta Pruning algorithm.
Heuristic evaluation function: Calculates the heuristic value for a given game state.
Board representation: Displays the game board, paddles, and puck.
Setup Instructions:

Make sure you have Python installed on your system (Python 3.6 or higher).
Install the required libraries using pip:
bash
Copy code
pip install pygame
Download the AI_tron.py file from the repository or package.
Explanation of Script:
The AI-driven AI Tron script implements a simple version of the Tron game, where two AI players compete against each other. The AI players use the Alpha-Beta Pruning algorithm to calculate their moves and avoid collisions while trying to eliminate the opponent.

Usage:

Run the AI_tron.py script.
bash
Copy code
python AI_tron.py
The game window will open, showing the AI players (paddles) and the puck (Tron bike).
The AI players will automatically start moving and try to eliminate the opponent.
Output:
The AI-driven AI Tron script will display a window with the game board, AI players, and the puck. The AI players will move automatically based on the calculated moves using the Alpha-Beta Pruning algorithm.
