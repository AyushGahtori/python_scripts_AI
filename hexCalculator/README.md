# Decimal To Hexadecimal

The aim of a decimal to hexadecimal (hex) calculator is to provide a tool that allows users to convert decimal numbers into their equivalent hexadecimal representation.

The code above creates a simple hex calculator using the Python tkinter library. The calculator allows users to add, subtract, multiply, and divide two hexadecimal numbers. The input fields are two text boxes where users can enter the hexadecimal numbers. The buttons at the bottom of the window perform the four operations. The output label displays the result of the operation.

## Language
- Python
    - Tkinter

## Setup instructions
Run the below command to show output
```
python hexCalculator.py
```

## Output
```
Here is the output of the code when the user enters 0x12 in the first text box, 0x34 in the second text box, and then clicks the Add button:
Result: 0x46
```
```
If the user enters 0x12 in the first text box and 0x34 in the second text box, and then clicks the Add button.
output: 0x46. 
This is the hexadecimal representation of the decimal number 56.
