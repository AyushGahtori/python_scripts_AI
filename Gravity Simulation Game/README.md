# Gravity Simulation Game

## Description

The Gravity Simulation Game is a 2D space-themed game developed in Python using the Pygame library. In this game, the player controls a spaceship that can be navigated using arrow keys or WASD. The objective is to reach a specific destination while avoiding collisions with celestial bodies that exert gravitational forces on the spaceship.

## Features

- Navigate the spaceship using arrow keys or WASD to control movement.
- Experience realistic gravitational effects from celestial bodies on the spaceship's trajectory.
- Multiple levels with increasing difficulty, each with different celestial bodies and positions.
- Fuel management: The spaceship consumes fuel while moving, and you need to collect fuel power-ups to refill it.
- Score and Timer: Try to reach the destination in the shortest time to achieve a higher score.
- Thrusters Animation: Animated thrusters give a visual representation of propulsion while controlling the spaceship.
- Sound Effects: Enjoy sound effects for spaceship movement, collisions, and other interactions.
- Gravity Indicator: Get a visual indicator of the direction and strength of gravitational forces from nearby celestial bodies.
- Background Music: Engage in the game with a background music track.
