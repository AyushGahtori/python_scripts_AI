# Pattern Recognition Game

## Introduction
Welcome to the Pattern Recognition Game! This is a text-based game where players are presented with sequences of color patterns and have to identify the underlying rule to predict the next pattern in the series.

## Rules
- The game will present you with a sequence of colors in a pattern.
- Your task is to figure out the underlying rule that governs the pattern and determine the next color in the sequence.
- For each round, you will have a limited number of attempts to guess the correct next pattern.
- If you guess the correct pattern, you score a point and move on to the next round. Otherwise, the game ends.

## Features
- Randomly generated color patterns.
- Timer: A time limit will be set for each round, and you must make your guess before time runs out.
- Levels: As you progress and score higher, the game will introduce higher levels of difficulty with longer patterns.

- Various colors and patterns for a diverse gaming experience.
