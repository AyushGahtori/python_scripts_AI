To delete all tweets using Twitter Archive and Python, you can utilize the Twitter API with the help of the `tweepy` library. However, please note that deleting tweets is a permanent action and cannot be undone. Make sure you have a backup of your tweets if needed. Here's a step-by-step guide:

1. Obtain API credentials:
   - Create a Twitter Developer account at https://developer.twitter.com/en/apps.
   - Create a new app and generate the required API keys and access tokens.

2. Install the `tweepy` library:
   ```python
   pip install tweepy
   ```

3. Download and extract your Twitter Archive:
   - Go to your Twitter account settings.
   - Under the "Your Twitter data" section, select "Download an archive of your data".
   - Follow the instructions to receive an email with a download link.
   - Download and extract the archive.

4. Write the Python script to delete tweets:
   ```python
   import tweepy
   import json

   # Twitter API credentials
   consumer_key = "YOUR_CONSUMER_KEY"
   consumer_secret = "YOUR_CONSUMER_SECRET"
   access_token = "YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN"
   access_token_secret = "YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET"

   # Authenticate to Twitter
   auth = tweepy.OAuthHandler(consumer_key, consumer_secret)
   auth.set_access_token(access_token, access_token_secret)

   # Create API object
   api = tweepy.API(auth)

   # Path to the extracted Twitter Archive JSON file
   archive_path = "PATH_TO_YOUR_TWITTER_ARCHIVE/data/js/tweets/"

   # Delete all tweets
   with open(archive_path + "tweet.js", "r") as file:
       tweets = json.load(file)

       for tweet in tweets:
           tweet_id = tweet["tweet"]["id_str"]
           try:
               api.destroy_status(tweet_id)
               print(f"Deleted tweet with ID: {tweet_id}")
           except tweepy.TweepError as e:
               print(f"Failed to delete tweet with ID: {tweet_id}\nError: {e}")
   ```

5. Replace the placeholders (`YOUR_CONSUMER_KEY`, `YOUR_CONSUMER_SECRET`, `YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN`, `YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET`, and `PATH_TO_YOUR_TWITTER_ARCHIVE`) in the script with your actual API credentials and the path to the extracted Twitter Archive folder.

6. Run the script:
   ```python
   python delete_tweets.py
   ```

The script will iterate over each tweet in your Twitter Archive and attempt to delete it using the Twitter API. It will print the tweet ID for successfully deleted tweets and any errors encountered for failed deletions.
