# Floating Text Effects

This Python script demonstrates how to create floating text effects. It prints each character of the text with a slight delay, giving the appearance of floating text.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/repository-name.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd repository-name
   ```

## Usage

1. Open the Python script in your preferred editor.

2. Customize the text by modifying the `print_floating_text` function calls.

   ```python
   print_floating_text("Hi, I am Shivansh Jain.")
   time.sleep(1)  # Simulating a delay
   print_floating_text("I am a Computer Science student.")
   time.sleep(1)  # Simulating a delay
   print_floating_text("I have added this python script which creates floating text effects.")
   time.sleep(1)  # Simulating a delay
   print_floating_text("I know full stack web development using HTML, CSS, Javascript, Django.")
   time.sleep(1)  # Simulating a delay
   print_floating_text("I like cricket, music and mythology.")
   ```

3. Adjust the sleep duration in the `print_floating_text` function to control the speed of the floating text.

4. Run the script:

   ```bash
   python script.py
   ```
