Discord News Bot

A Simple discord news bot which fetches news articles using a news API and responds to them with AI generated prompts, thanks to the OpenAI API.

Note that this bot will take time to set up as it is important to set up all API keys and client secrets properly.

# Steps

- Replace ``YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY`` with your OpenAI API key
- Replace ``'YOUR_DISCORD_TOKEN`` with your Discord bot's token
- Replace the ``"apiKey"`` value pair in the ``params`` dictionary with your NewsAPI key
