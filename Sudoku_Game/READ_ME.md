The Sudoku game in Python.

Rules of the Game
Sudoku is a number placement puzzle game that is played on a 9x9 grid. The goal of the game is to fill in the empty cells of the grid with numbers from 1 to 9, such that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3x3 sub-grids (also called "boxes" or "regions") contains all of the numbers from 1 to 9 without repetition.

The rules of Sudoku are as follows:

Each row must contain all numbers from 1 to 9 without repetition.
Each column must contain all numbers from 1 to 9 without repetition.
Each 3x3 sub-grid (box) must contain all numbers from 1 to 9 without repetition.

The player's task is to fill in the remaining empty cells with numbers from 1 to 9, following the rules above.
