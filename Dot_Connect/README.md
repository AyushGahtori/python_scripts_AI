# Dot Connect
Dot Connect is a two-player game where players compete to create boxes by connecting dots with lines. 

## Game Objective
The objective of Dot Connect is to score the most points by creating boxes on the game grid. A box is formed when a player closes it with the fourth line. Each completed box scores a point for the player who created it.

# Package/Script Name

The script utilizes the **Tkinter library** to create a graphical user interface (GUI) for the game. It provides a canvas where players can click in between two dots to draw lines and track their scores. The game board consists of a grid of dots, and players take turns drawing horizontal or vertical lines between adjacent dots. When a player completes a square by closing off the fourth side, they earn a point and get an additional turn.

The script keeps track of each player's score and displays it in a separate info frame within the GUI. The game continues until all squares on the grid are completed, and a "GAME OVER" message is displayed.
