# Automated Email Scheduler

This code is a Python script that allows you to send automated emails using the smtplib library. The script prompts the user for their email credentials, recipient's email address, desired email sending time, and the message to be sent. The email will be sent using a Gmail SMTP server.

# Working

- Provide your email credentials, recipient's email, email sending time (in YYYY,MM,DD,HH,MM format), and the message.
- The script will wait until the specified time before sending the email.

# Requirements

- smtplib
