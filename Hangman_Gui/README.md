# Hangman Game (GUI-Based)

This is a simple implementation of the classic Hangman game in Python with a graphical user interface (GUI) using Tkinter. Players guess a secret word letter by letter, with a limited number of attempts.

## How to Play

1. Run the `hangman_gui.py` script in your Python environment.
2. A graphical window will pop up with the Hangman game interface.
3. The game will choose a random word from a predefined list.
4. You need to guess the word by entering one letter at a time in the input field provided.
5. Click the "Guess" button or press Enter to submit your guess.
6. The game will display your progress, the letters you've guessed correctly, and the attempts left.
7. If you guess all the letters correctly before running out of attempts, you win!
8. If you run out of attempts before guessing the word, you lose.

Enjoy the game and have fun!
