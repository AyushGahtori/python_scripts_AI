## Customization

You can customize the story generator by modifying the predefined lists in the script. Here's what each list represents:

- `characters`: A list of characters that can be the protagonist or main characters of the story.
- `settings`: A list of different settings or locations where the story can take place.
- `actions`: A list of actions or events that can happen in the story.
- `conclusions`: A list of possible endings or conclusions to the story.


Each story generated will have a similar structure but with different elements randomly chosen from the lists.
