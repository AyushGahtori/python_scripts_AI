## What is it

- It's a very useful algorithm to find the over the many disconnected bridges over the hierholzer algo.
- This algorithm is the alternative of Hierholzer's Algorithm of directed graph.
- This algorithm is used to find the euclerian circuit but this algorithm can also find the path in the disconnected graph also.
