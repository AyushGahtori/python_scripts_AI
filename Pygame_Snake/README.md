Package/Script Name: Snake Game in Pygame

Short description of package/script:
This package provides a simple implementation of the classic "Snake" game using Python's Pygame library. It allows players to control a snake and eat food to grow longer while avoiding collisions with the screen boundaries and its own body.

Functionalities/Scripts:

snake_game.py: Implements the Snake game with basic features such as snake movement, food spawning, collision detection, and scoring.
Setup instructions:

Ensure you have Python installed on your system (Python 3.x is recommended).
Install the Pygame library by running the following command:
Copy code
pip install pygame
Download the snake_game.py script.
Explain how to set up and run your package/script in the user's system:

Open a terminal or command prompt.
Navigate to the directory where you saved snake_game.py.
Run the script using the following command:
Copy code
python snake_game.py
Detailed explanation of script:

The script initializes the Pygame module and sets up the game window, screen dimensions, colors, and clock for frame rate control.
It sets the initial position, speed, and body of the snake and randomly spawns food on the screen.
The game loop continuously checks for events such as keyboard inputs, food collision, boundaries, and self-collision.
When the snake eats the food, it grows longer, and a new food spawns at a random location.
If the snake collides with the screen boundaries or its own body, the game ends.
The screen is updated with the snake and food positions in each iteration, creating the illusion of movement.
Output:
[Here, you can provide images, gifs, or videos of the game in action, demonstrating how the snake moves, eats food, and the game over scenario.]
