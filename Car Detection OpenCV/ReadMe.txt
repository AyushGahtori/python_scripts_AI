Car Tracking using YOLO and OpenCV:

This project demonstrates car tracking in videos using the YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection model and the OpenCV library. The YOLO model is used to detect cars in each frame of a video stream, and bounding boxes are drawn around the detected cars to track their movement.
