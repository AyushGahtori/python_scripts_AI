# Coding Language Learning Game

This is a Python-based interactive game that helps users learn coding languages by solving programming challenges in a gamified environment. Players have to guess the output of Python code snippets, earn points for correct guesses, and progress through different difficulty levels.

## Features

- Multiple Difficulty Levels: Choose from easy, medium, and hard levels, each with corresponding sets of code snippets.
- Time Limit: Each code snippet comes with a time limit. The player must guess the output within the specified time to earn points.
- Lives System: Start with a certain number of lives and lose one for each incorrect guess. The game ends when all lives are lost.
- Hints: Players can request hints for code snippets to receive some guidance.
- Score Multipliers: Earn bonus points for consecutive correct guesses.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required packages listed in `requirements.txt` using pip:
3. Run the `coding_language_learning_game.py` script in your Python environment to start the game.
4. Choose a difficulty level and start guessing the output of the given Python code snippets.

## How to Play

1. Select a difficulty level (easy, medium, hard) at the beginning of the game.
2. A Python code snippet will be displayed, and you need to guess the output within the time limit.
3. If your guess is correct, you earn 10 points.
4. If your guess is incorrect or time runs out, you lose a life.
5. The game continues until you run out of lives or decide to stop playing.
6. Your final score will be displayed at the end of the game.
