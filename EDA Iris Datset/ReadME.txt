The Iris dataset is a classic dataset for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). It contains measurements of sepal and petal dimensions for three species of iris flowers. EDA involves visualizing and understanding the relationships, distributions, and variations in the data, aiding in classification and pattern recognition tasks in machine learning.
