# File Downloader Script


A file downloader script is a program or script that automates the process of downloading files from a given URL. It enables users to retrieve files from the internet without manual intervention.

File downloader scripts typically use the HTTP or FTP protocols to establish a connection with a server hosting the desired file. They send a request to the server and retrieve the file's content, which is then saved to a local destination on the user's machine.

## Instructions üìù

### Step 1:

	Save the Script: Save the script code provided earlier in a file with the desired name, such as file_downloader.py. Make sure to save it with the .py extension, indicating that it is a Python script.

### Step 2:

   Install Dependencies: Ensure that you have the necessary dependencies installed. In this case, the script relies on the requests library. You can install it using the pip package manager. Open a command prompt or terminal and run the following command:
	
   pip install requests

### Step 3:

	Customize the Script (Optional): Depending on your specific requirements, you can customize the script. For example, you can modify the file_url variable to point to the URL of the file you want to download, and set the save_as variable to specify the destination path and filename.

### Step 4:

	Run the Script: Open a command prompt or terminal, navigate to the directory where the script is saved, and run the following command:

    python file_downloader.py

### Step 5:  

    Check the Output: The script will attempt to download the file from the specified URL and save it to the destination path. You will see either a success message or a failure message displayed in the command prompt or terminal, depending on the outcome of the download operation.


### Step 6:      

   Verify the Downloaded File: After running the script, check the destination path specified in the save_as variable. If the download was successful, you should find the downloaded file at that location.
