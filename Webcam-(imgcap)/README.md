# Webcam Image Capture
This project provides a simple code snippet to capture images from a webcam using OpenCV in Python. It utilizes the OpenCV library to access the webcam, capture frames, and save them as JPEG images.

## Features
- Accesses the webcam and captures frames in real-time.
- Saves captured frames as JPEG images with unique filenames based on timestamps.
- Provides a basic implementation that can be easily integrated into larger projects.

## Installation
To run this code, you need to have OpenCV installed. You can install OpenCV using:
 
```
pip install opencv-python
```

## Usage
1. Import the necessary libraries: cv2 and time.
2. Create a VideoCapture object to access the webcam.
3. Set up a loop to continuously capture frames from the webcam.
4. Generate a unique filename for each captured frame based on the current timestamp.
5. Save the captured frame as a JPEG image using the imwrite() function from OpenCV.
6. Set the loop termination condition as needed.
7. Release the webcam resource using the release() method of the VideoCapture object.
