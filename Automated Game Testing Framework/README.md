# Automated Game Testing Framework

The Automated Game Testing Framework is a tool designed to help game developers efficiently test various aspects of their games, including gameplay mechanics, UI interactions, and performance. This framework provides a structured approach to writing and running automated tests, helping identify issues and ensure the quality of the game.

## Features

- Automated testing of game functions and interactions.
- Simulated game environment for testing.
- Example test cases to get started.
- Easily extensible for more complex testing scenarios.
- Integration with common testing libraries.

## Requirements

- Python
- Required Python packages (install using `pip`):

```bash
pip install unittest
```

Additional packages may be required depending on your specific testing needs.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.

## Usage

1. Open the `game_testing_framework.py` file and customize the `Game` class with your game functions and mechanics.
2. Add more test cases and assertions as needed to thoroughly test your game.

### Running Tests

To run the tests, execute the following command:

```bash
python game_testing_framework.py
```

The tests will be executed, and the results will be displayed in the terminal.

## Advanced Usage

This framework serves as a foundation for automated testing. Depending on your game's complexity, you might need to integrate additional tools and libraries for UI testing, performance testing, and continuous integration.
