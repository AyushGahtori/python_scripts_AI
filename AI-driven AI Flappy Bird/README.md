Package/Script Name: AI-driven AI Flappy Bird

Short Description: AI-driven AI Flappy Bird is a Python script that implements an AI player for the game "Flappy Bird." The AI player uses the Genetic Algorithm to learn and play the game automatically, aiming to achieve a high score.

Functionalities/Script:

FlappyBirdGame class: Represents the Flappy Bird game and handles game logic.
AI_agent class: Implements the AI player using the Genetic Algorithm to learn and play the game.
Heuristic evaluation function: Calculates the fitness of each AI agent based on its performance in the game.
Board representation: Displays the game window, bird, and pipes.
Setup Instructions:

Make sure you have Python installed on your system (Python 3.6 or higher).
Install the required libraries using pip:
bash
Copy code
pip install pygame
Download the AI_flappy_bird.py file from the repository or package.
Explanation of Script:
The AI-driven AI Flappy Bird script utilizes the Genetic Algorithm to train AI agents to play the Flappy Bird game. The AI agents aim to learn how to navigate through pipes by optimizing their performance over multiple generations.

Usage:

Run the AI_flappy_bird.py script.
bash
Copy code
python AI_flappy_bird.py
The game window will open, and the AI agents will start playing Flappy Bird.
Observe how the AI agents improve their performance over generations.
Output:
The AI-driven AI Flappy Bird script will display a game window where AI agents play the Flappy Bird game. The script will continuously show the performance of the current generation of AI agents. The AI agents will learn and adapt to navigate through the pipes more effectively over generations.
