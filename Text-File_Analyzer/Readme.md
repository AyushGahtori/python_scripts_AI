# Text File Analyzer

This Python script reads a text file and provides a basic analysis by counting the number of lines, words, and characters in the file.

## Usage

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.

2. Save the script as `text_file_analyzer.py` in your desired directory.

3. Run the script using a terminal or command prompt.

4. The script will prompt you to enter the path of the text file you want to analyze.

5. After entering the file path, the script will display the following information:
   - Number of lines in the file
   - Number of words in the file
   - Number of characters in the file

## Example

Suppose you have a text file named `sample.txt` with the following content:

This is a sample text file.
It contains multiple lines of text.
Let's see how the analyzer handles it.

Running the script and providing the path to `sample.txt` would output:
Number of lines: 3
Number of words: 17
Number of characters: 96

## Note

This script provides a basic analysis for simple text files. It may not handle complex file formats or special cases.
