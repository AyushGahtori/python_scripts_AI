# Speech to Text Conversion

This Python script demonstrates how to convert audio input into text using the `speech_recognition` library. It utilizes the `recognize_google` function from the library to convert the speech into text.

## Prerequisites
- Python 
- `speech_recognition` library (install using `pip install SpeechRecognition`)
- `pyaudio` library (install using `pip install pyaudio`)

Note: The `pyaudio` library is required for microphone access and recording audio.

## Usage
1. Ensure that you have a working microphone connected to your computer.
2. Run the script and speak into the microphone when prompted.
3. The script will convert the audio to text using the Google Speech Recognition service.
4. If the speech is recognized, the converted text will be displayed.
5. Now, you can do whatever operations you want with the input text.
