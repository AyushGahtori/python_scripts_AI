# File Downloader Script


This script is about file encryption and decryption using the Fernet symmetric encryption algorithm from the cryptography library in Python.

The script provides functions to generate an encryption key, load the key from a file, encrypt a specified file, and decrypt a previously encrypted file.

## Instructions üìù

### Step 1:

	Make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can download and install Python from the official Python website (https://www.python.org).

### Step 2:

    Open a text editor and copy the script provided in the previous response into a new file.



### Step 3:

    Save the file with a .py extension, such as file_encryption.py


### Step 4:

	Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you saved the Python script.


### Step 5:  

    Check the Output: The script will attempt to download the file from the specified URL and save it to the destination path. You will see either a success message or a failure message displayed in the command prompt or terminal, depending on the outcome of the download operation.


### Step 6:      

    If you haven't generated a key before, uncomment the generate_key() line in the script by removing the # character at the beginning of the line. This line should only be executed once to generate the key. After generating the key, you can comment out the generate_key() line again by adding the # character.

### step 7:

    Run the script again (python file_encryption.py) to encrypt the file specified in the file_to_encrypt variable. It will print a success message when the encryption is complete.

### step 8:
    To decrypt the file, run the script once more (python file_encryption.py). It will use the same key to decrypt the file, and print a success message when the decryption is complete.
