Package/Script Name: AI-based AI Maze Solver

Short Description: AI-based AI Maze Solver is a Python script that implements an AI algorithm to solve a maze automatically. The AI uses the A* (A-Star) search algorithm with a heuristic function to efficiently navigate through the maze and find the shortest path to the goal.

Functionalities/Script:

MazeSolver class: Represents the AI-based maze solver.
A* algorithm: Implements the A* search algorithm with a heuristic function to find the shortest path.
Heuristic function: Calculates the estimated cost (heuristic) from a cell to the goal to guide the A* search.
Setup Instructions:

Make sure you have Python installed on your system (Python 3.6 or higher).
Download the AI_maze_solver.py file from the repository or package.
Explanation of Script:
The AI-based AI Maze Solver script enables you to solve mazes automatically using the A* search algorithm. The A* algorithm combines the cost to reach a cell (path cost) with an estimated cost to the goal (heuristic) to efficiently explore the maze and find the shortest path.

Usage:

Create a maze representation as a 2D array, where 0 represents empty cells, 1 represents obstacles/walls, and 2 represents the starting position. For example:
python
Copy code
maze = [
    [1, 1, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 1, 1, 0, 1],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 1],
    [1, 1, 0, 1, 0],
    [2, 0, 0, 1, 1],
]
Initialize the MazeSolver class with the maze.
python
Copy code
from AI_maze_solver import MazeSolver

maze_solver = MazeSolver(maze)
Use the find_path() method to get the shortest path from the starting position to the goal.
python
Copy code
path = maze_solver.find_path()
print("Shortest Path:", path)
Output:
The AI-based AI Maze Solver script will output the shortest path from the starting position to the goal in the maze.
