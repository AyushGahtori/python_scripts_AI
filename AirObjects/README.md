### Air Object Detector

Install with Pypi:

pip3 install pyransac3d
Take a look:
Example 1 - Planar RANSAC
import pyransac3d as pyrsc

points = load_points(.) # Load your point cloud as a numpy array (N, 3)

plane1 = pyrsc.Plane()
best_eq, best_inliers = plane1.fit(points, 0.01)
Results in the plane equation Ax+By+Cz+D: [0.720, -0.253, 0.646, 1.100]

Example 2 - Spherical RANSAC
Loading a noisy sphere's point cloud with r = 5 centered in 0 we can use the following code:

import pyransac3d as pyrsc

points = load_points(.) # Load your point cloud as a numpy array (N, 3)

You can find the animations you see in the documentation on branch Animations. It needs Open3D library to run. The Animation branch is not regularly maintained, it only exists to create some cool visualizations ;D
