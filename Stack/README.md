# **Stack**
Stacks are a fundamental data structure that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle. In a stack, elements are added and removed from the same end, known as the top of the stack.


## **Explanation**
1. ### **Stack**
    A stack implementation using an array or a fixed-size container is one of the most common approaches. The menu-driven code for a stack typically includes options such as pushing (adding) an element, popping (removing) an element, displaying the stack, checking if it is empty, checking if it is full, and exiting the program. The code needs to handle cases where the stack becomes empty or full.

2. ### **Dynamic Stack using Linked List**
    A dynamic stack implemented using a linked list allows for a stack with dynamic memory allocation. The menu-driven code for a dynamic stack using a linked list provides options to push (add) elements, pop (remove) elements, display the stack, check if it is empty, check if it is full (not applicable for linked list implementation), and exit.

## **Setup Instructions**

1. Install Python
2. Verify Python Installation

    ```bash
    python --version
    ```

3. Run the Python Script
    ```bash
    python filename.py
    ```

    Note: Replace `filename.py` with the name of the python file which is to be executed.
