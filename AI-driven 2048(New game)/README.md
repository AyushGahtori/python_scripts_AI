Package/Script Name: AI-Driven 2048

Short description: AI-Driven 2048 is a Python package that implements an AI player for the popular 2048 game using the Expectimax algorithm. The AI player tries to maximize the score by making informed decisions to achieve higher tile values and ultimately reaching the 2048 tile.

Functionalities/Scripts:

AI2048 class: Implements the AI player for the 2048 game using the Expectimax algorithm.
get_best_move(): Returns the best move (left, right, up, or down) for the current board state based on the Expectimax algorithm.
Setup Instructions:

Ensure you have Python installed on your system (Python 3.6 or higher).
Install the required libraries using pip:
bash
Copy code
pip install numpy
Download the AI2048.py file from the repository or package.
Explanation of Script:
The AI2048 class represents the AI player for the 2048 game. It has methods to calculate the heuristic score, perform moves (left, right, up, down), generate children states, and use the Expectimax algorithm to choose the best move based on the current board state.

Usage:

Create a 4x4 board with the initial tile configuration. The value 0 represents an empty cell.
python
Copy code
board = [
    [0, 2, 2, 4],
    [0, 2, 0, 4],
    [0, 4, 2, 0],
    [0, 0, 2, 2]
]
Initialize the AI2048 class with the board configuration.
python
Copy code
from AI2048 import AI2048

ai = AI2048(board)
To get the best move for the current board state, call the get_best_move() method.
python
Copy code
best_move = ai.get_best_move()
print("Best Move:", best_move)
Perform the best move and update the board state accordingly.
python
Copy code
ai.move(best_move)
Output:
The script will output the best move (left, right, up, or down) based on the current board state.
