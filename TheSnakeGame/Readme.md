# The Snake Game

The Snake Game is a classic arcade game where the player controls a snake, guiding it to eat food and grow longer. The objective is to achieve the highest score possible without colliding with the snake's own body or the boundaries of the game.

## Game Description
In this version of the Snake Game, you control the snake using the arrow keys on your keyboard. The snake moves in four directions: up, down, left, and right. The snake's body consists of green squares, and the food is represented by a red oval. Each time the snake eats the food, it grows longer, and your score increases. The game ends when the snake collides with itself or hits the game boundaries.
