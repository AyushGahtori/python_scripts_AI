Early life:

Selena Marie Gomez was born on July 22, 1992, in Grand Prairie, Texas,[1] to Ricardo Joel Gomez and Texas-born[2] former stage actress Mandy Teefey.[3] She was named after Tejano singer Selena Quintanilla, who died in 1995.[4][5] Her father is of Mexican descent, while her mother, who was adopted, has Italian ancestry.[6][7][8] Gomez's paternal grandparents emigrated to Texas from Monterrey in the 1970s.[9] Of her heritage, Gomez has said she is "a proud third-generation American-Mexican"[10] and "My family does have quinceañeras, and we go to the communion church. We do everything that's Catholic, but we don't really have anything traditional except go to the park and have barbecues on Sundays after church."[11] Gomez was fluent in Spanish until age seven.[9][clarification needed] Her parents divorced when she was five years old, and she remained with her mother.[3][12] Gomez has two younger half-sisters and a younger stepbrother: Gracie Elliot Teefey, through Mandy and her second husband, Brian Teefey,[13][14] and Victoria "Tori" and Marcus Gomez, through Ricardo and his second wife, Sara.[15] She earned her high-school diploma through homeschooling in May 2010.[16]
Gomez was born when her mother was 16 years old.[17] The family had financial troubles throughout Gomez's childhood, her mother struggling to provide for the pair. At one point, Gomez recalls that they had to search for quarters just to get gas for their car. Her mother later recalled that the two would frequently walk to their local dollar store to buy spaghetti for dinner.[18] Gomez has said, "I was frustrated that my parents weren't together, and never saw the light at the end of the tunnel where my mom was working hard to provide a better life for me. I'm terrified of what I would have become if I'd stayed [in Texas]."[19] She later added that her mother "was really strong around me. Having me at 16 had to have been a big responsibility. She gave up everything for me, had three jobs, supported me, sacrificed her life for me." Gomez had a close relationship with her grandparents as a child and appeared in various pageants. Her grandparents often took care of her while her parents finished their schooling, and she has said they "raised her" until she found success in show business.[20]

Career:


2002–2006: Career beginnings:

Gomez first gained an interest in pursuing a career in entertainment watching her mother prepare for stage productions.[21] In 2002, she began her acting career on the children's television series Barney & Friends,[22][23] portraying the character Gianna.[24] The show was her first acting gig. Gomez recalled of the experience, "I was very shy when I was little [...] I didn't know what 'camera right' was. I didn't know what blocking was. I learned everything from Barney."[25] Gomez appeared in thirteen episodes of the show between 2002 and 2004; the show's producers released her as she was "too old" for the series.[25] While working on Barney & Friends, Gomez had bit part roles in the film Spy Kids 3-D: Game Over (2003) and the made-for-television film Walker, Texas Ranger: Trial by Fire (2005).[26][27] She guest starred in a 2006 episode of the Disney Channel series The Suite Life of Zack & Cody.[28][27]

The first, titled What Boys Want, would feature Gomez as a girl who could hear the thoughts of men.[57] She later announced a film adaptation of the novel Thirteen Reasons Why, in which she was to play a young girl who commits suicide; ultimately, neither film was made,[58] but Gomez would later executive produce a television adaptation of Thirteen Reasons Why.[59]

Hoping to cross over into the music industry, Gomez formed the pop rock band Selena Gomez & the Scene through her record deal with Hollywood Records.[73] The name of the band is an "ironic jab" at the people who called Gomez a "wannabe scene".[74] The group released their first studio album, Kiss & Tell, in August 2009,[75][76] which debuted at number nine on the Billboard 200 albums chart in the U.S. with first-week sales of 66,000 copies.[77] The album received mixed reviews, with some critics praising its "fun" nature and others criticizing Gomez's vocal performance.[78][79] Although the lead single was not commercially successful,[51] the second single, "Naturally", reached number twenty-nine in the U.S. and number seven in the United Kingdom,[51][80] and was certified 4× Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).[81] In July 2010, Gomez starred alongside Joey King in Ramona and Beezus, a film adaptation of the children's novel series by Beverly Cleary, in which she portrayed Beezus Quimby.[82][83] The film was well received by critics;[84] Roger Ebert described it as "a sweet salute", and found both actresses "appealing".[85] Gomez later reprised the voice role of Princess Selenia in Arthur 3: The War of the Two Worlds (2010).[86]

Despite earlier claims that she would be taking a break from music, Gomez announced in March 2013 the release of her solo debut album.[134] In April 2013, Gomez released "Come & Get It" as the lead single.[135] It became Gomez's first top-ten entry on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100, reaching number six.[136][137] The song also reached the top ten on charts in Canada and the U.K.[138] The second single, "Slow Down", peaked at number twenty-seven in the U.S.[136] Stars Dance was released in July 2013.[139] The record is musically rooted in EDM and electropop.[140][141] It became her first album to debut at number one in the U.S., selling 97,000 copies in its first week,[91][142] and also reached number one in Canada.[143] It received mixed reviews from music critics, with some noticing her inability to create her own musical identity and panning her vocal abilities.[144][145] Gomez incorporated choreographed dance routines into the album's music videos and her promotional live performances, having been inspired by artists such as Janet Jackson and Britney Spears.[146][147] The video of "Come & Get It" won the Best Pop Video at the 2013 MTV Video Music Awards.[148]

Gomez addressed the controversy, saying that "We stayed very true to the book and that's initially what [author] Jay Asher created was a beautifully tragic, complicated yet suspenseful story and I think that's what we wanted to do. We wanted to do it justice and, yeah, [the backlash is] gonna come no matter what. It's not an easy subject to talk about, but I'm very fortunate with how it's doing.[249] Despite the controversy, the first season was a critical success.[250] However, the other three seasons received generally negative reviews.[251][252][253] 13 Reasons Why was the most tweeted about show of 2017, and the most-watched original streaming series of 2018.[254][255] In 2022, its second season ranks as the ninth most watched English-language television series on Netflix, with 496.1 million hours viewed within 28 days of release.[256][257] The series ended after four seasons in June 2020.[258] Gomez recorded a cover version of the song "Only You" for the series' first season soundtrack.[259]
