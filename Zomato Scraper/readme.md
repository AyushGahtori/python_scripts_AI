# Infinite Scroll Web Scraping

This Python script uses Selenium and BeautifulSoup to perform web scraping with infinite scroll on the Zomato website. The script navigates to a specific page on Zomato that lists cafes in Ahmedabad, India, and extracts details such as name, link, rating, cuisine, and rate for each cafe.

## Requirements

- Google Chrome (or another browser) with a compatible version of ChromeDriver
- ChromeDriver (compatible with your Chrome version)

## Working

The script will start scraping the cafes on the Zomato page. It will scroll down the page and print the details of each cafe until you interrupt the process (e.g., using Ctrl + C).
