**User Guide: AI Calculator**

This user guide provides step-by-step instructions on how to use the AI Calculator script in the Amazing-Python-Scripts repository. This script uses the ChatterBot library to create a calculator chatbot that can evaluate mathematical expressions.

**Step 1: Install Dependencies**
Before you can use the AI Calculator script, you need to make sure that you have all the necessary dependencies installed. This script requires Python 3 and the ChatterBot library. To install these dependencies, open a terminal or command prompt and run the following command:
```
pip install chatterbot
```

**Step 2: Download the Script**
Next, you need to download the AI Calculator script from the Amazing-Python-Scripts repository. You can do this by visiting the repository on GitHub and navigating to the `AI Calculator` directory. From there, you can download the `main.py` file to your computer.

**Step 3: Run the Script**
Once you have downloaded the script, you can run it by opening a terminal or command prompt, navigating to the directory where you saved the file, and running the following command:
```
python main.py
```
This will start the script and open a command-line interface where you can interact with the calculator chatbot.

**Step 4: Use the Calculator**
To use the AI Calculator, simply type a mathematical expression at the prompt and press enter. The calculator chatbot will evaluate the expression and return the result. For example:
```
me: 2 + 2
Calculator: 4
```
You can enter any valid mathematical expression, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation. The calculator chatbot will evaluate the expression and return the result.

To exit the calculator, simply type `quit` at the prompt and press enter.

You can experiment with different expressions to see how they are evaluated by the calculator chatbot.
