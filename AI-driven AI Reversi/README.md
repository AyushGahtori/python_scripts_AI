Package/Script Name: AI-driven AI Reversi

Short Description: AI-driven AI Reversi is a Python script that implements an AI player for the game "Reversi," also known as "Othello." The AI player uses the MiniMax algorithm with Alpha-Beta Pruning to make strategic moves and compete against human players or other AI agents.

Functionalities/Script:

ReversiGame class: Represents the Reversi game and handles game logic.
AI_agent class: Implements the AI player using the MiniMax algorithm with Alpha-Beta Pruning to make intelligent moves.
Heuristic evaluation function: Calculates the utility value for a given game state to guide the AI's decision-making process.
Board representation: Displays the game board with the pieces of both players.
Setup Instructions:

Make sure you have Python installed on your system (Python 3.6 or higher).
Download the AI_reversi.py file from the repository or package.
Explanation of Script:
The AI-driven AI Reversi script enables you to play the classic Reversi game against an AI player that uses the MiniMax algorithm with Alpha-Beta Pruning. The AI player aims to find the best move that maximizes its chances of winning while minimizing the opponent's opportunities.

Usage:

Run the AI_reversi.py script.
bash
Copy code
python AI_reversi.py
The game window will open, displaying the Reversi board with the initial setup.
The game will prompt the players to take turns and make their moves using the mouse.
Output:
The AI-driven AI Reversi script will display a graphical game window showing the Reversi board with the pieces of both players. The script will guide you through the game, and you can play against the AI player that uses the MiniMax algorithm to make intelligent moves.
