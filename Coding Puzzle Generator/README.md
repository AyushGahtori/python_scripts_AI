# Coding Puzzle Generator

Welcome to the Coding Puzzle Generator! This Python script generates interactive coding puzzles with various difficulty levels and different programming topics. It currently includes three types of puzzles: arithmetic, string manipulation, and logical puzzles.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository or download the `coding_puzzle_generator.py` script.

2. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.

3. Run the script using the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

```bash
python coding_puzzle_generator.py
```

4. You will be prompted to choose a difficulty level (easy, medium, or hard) for the puzzle. Enter your choice and hit Enter.

5. Solve the puzzle displayed in the console.

6. If you get stuck or need a hint, you can enter `hint` as your answer, and the script will provide a hint for the current puzzle.

7. You have three attempts to solve each puzzle. If you enter an incorrect answer, the script will inform you of the remaining attempts.

8. After completing or exhausting your attempts, the script will reveal the correct answer and move on to the next puzzle.

## Puzzle Types

### 1. Arithmetic Puzzle
Arithmetic puzzles involve basic arithmetic operations with random numbers. Your task is to solve the arithmetic expression and provide the correct answer.

### 2. String Manipulation Puzzle
String manipulation puzzles challenge you to perform tasks like rearranging letters or replacing characters in a given word. You must reveal the original word based on the provided puzzle.

### 3. Logical Puzzle
Logical puzzles include tasks related to boolean logic using `and`, `or`, and `not` operators. You need to evaluate the logical expression and provide the correct boolean result.

## Customization

You can easily customize the puzzle types, difficulty levels, and hints by modifying the `generate_puzzle()` function in the `coding_puzzle_generator.py` script. Feel free to add more puzzle types and enhance the interactive solving experience.
