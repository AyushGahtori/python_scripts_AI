# AI Code Reviewer

The AI Code Reviewer is a Python script that analyzes and provides feedback on programming code. It utilizes a combination of rule-based checks and code style analysis to detect common coding errors, suggest improvements, and evaluate the overall code quality. Additionally, it performs comment analysis to identify areas where code comments may need improvement.

## Features

- Indentation Error Detection: The code reviewer checks for indentation errors in loops, conditionals, and functions.
- Undefined Variable Detection: It identifies variables that are used but not defined within the code.
- Code Style Checking: The script uses the `pycodestyle` library to check for code style violations and provides feedback on code formatting.
- Comment Analysis: The script examines code comments and suggests improvements for better readability and clarity.

## Prerequisites

Before running the script, make sure you have Python installed on your system. Also, ensure you have the `pycodestyle` library installed by running the following command:

```bash
pip install pycodestyle
```

## Usage
- Clone the repository or download the "ai_code_reviewer.py" script.
- Run the script, and it will analyze the Python code provided within the script.
- The AI Code Reviewer will output feedback on any coding errors, style issues, or comment suggestions.
