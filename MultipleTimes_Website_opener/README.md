The provided code is a Python script that utilizes the `webbrowser` module to open a specified website multiple times in separate browser tabs. 

Here is a description and documentation for the code:

1. The `webbrowser` module is imported at the beginning of the code. This module provides a high-level interface to allow displaying web-based documents to users.

The webbrowser module is a standard library module in Python, which means it is already included with your Python installation. You don't need to install it separately. It should be available and ready to use without any additional steps.

2. The user is prompted to enter the number of times they want to open the website. The input is stored in the variable `n` as an integer.

3. A `for` loop is used to iterate `n` times. The loop variable `e` represents the current iteration.

4. Inside the loop, the `webbrowser.open_new_tab()` function is called, passing the URL of the website to open as an argument. This function opens the URL in a new browser tab.

5. After the loop completes all iterations, the script execution ends.

Note: It's worth mentioning that the `webbrowser` module's behavior may vary depending on the operating system and the default web browser settings. Additionally, some web browsers may restrict or block the automatic opening of multiple tabs for security reasons.
